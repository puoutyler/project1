# project1 A Take on the classic Wheel of fortune.

Made fully using only HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This is one of my favorite person projects as it was my first project through my General Assembly bootcamp and created while still grasping a fully knowledge on Javascript. This best displays my Javascript skills by utilizing many different skills inclduing loops, complex functions, and especially proud of the wheel that has the ability to randomly select a degree from an array of options.

So spin the wheel, guess a letter, and solve that puzzle for big prizes!
